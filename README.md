# Invade

Project is being moved to [InvadeV2] while I try out libgdx.


Invade is an Android game inspired by ICE

See [ICE gameplay]. I hope to get a video of Invade gameplay soon.

> More or less its a minimalist real-time strategy game.
> I figured that ICE was a little boring even with Advanced
Mode and I didn't feel like forking over money for the 
> enhanced version. So why not clone it and improve it?
> In the process, I could learn a little bit about Android
> game development, as well as *finally* make a full game.
