# Invade

Invade is an Android game inspired by ICE

See [ICE gameplay]. I hope to get a video of Invade gameplay soon.

> More or less its a minimalist real-time strategy game.
> I figured that ICE was a little boring even with Advanced
Mode and I didn't feel like forking over money for the

> In the process, I could learn a little bit about Android

The project is made with Eclipse ADT, so after downloading [Eclipse ADT],
download the project and: 
```sh
$ File > Import > Existing Project From Workspace
```

## Todo
Right now, the app just opens up a scene with some spinning polygons.
I'm fabricating the actual gameplay, so hold on tight.
