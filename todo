Control flow:
  TitleScene: Create it
  LevelChooserScene: Render level map
  LevelMap: Assign levels
  Level: Create a bunch of levels!
  EndGameScene: Have fonts and tie back to LevelChooserScene


Actual game play stuff:
  WhiteAI: decide target based on attacking units
       AI: defend sometimes against attacking units


Game experience:
  PlayerAttributes: Fine tune parameters
  TextureObject: Finish loading textures, give it a shot.
                 
  
Logistics:
  --Speed it up.
  --Parallelize where possible

  
Possible design ideas:
  AI: different colors have different techniques
  Human: command different legions with bounding box selection
         Select all units button on screen
