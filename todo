Control flow:
  TitleScene: Create it
  MenuScene: Map choices
  EndGameScene: Have fonts and tie back to MenuScene


Actual game play stuff:
  WhiteAI: decide target based on attacking units
       AI: defend sometimes against attacking units


Game experience:
  PlayerAttributes: Fine tune parameters
  GamePlayScene: See things at certain zooms
  TextureObject: Finish loading textures, give it a shot.
                 
  
  
Logistics:
  --Reduce reallocation: Optimize ColoredCircleCollider
  --Parallelize where possible

  
Possible design ideas:
  AI: different colors have different techniques
  Human: command different legions with bounding box selection
         Select all units button on screen
